  General
-----------
* RunX and RunXcmd both work on all versions of Windows.
* RunX and RunXcmd are both stand-alone portable applications, which 
  can be run from anywhere, and without any external dependencies.


------------
  RunX.exe
------------
Use this program when you need a graphical user interface.  

You can use command line arguments with RunX.exe the same as RunXcmd.exe,
however there will be no console output, and the /wait argument will have 
no effect in scripting.  RunX.exe /? will show the help screen.

TIPS:  Drag and drop a file onto RunX.exe to automatically populate the 
       run dialog with that file.


---------------
  RunXcmd.exe
---------------
Use this program in scripting, when you need console output, or you need 
your script to wait on the file you are running.  

Run RunXcmd.exe with no arguments to see current usage.  Run directly from
Windows Explorer via double-click and it will pause so you can read all the 
notes before disappearing.
